Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of calorie counts across menu items.
Explore the nutritional content (e.g., fat, protein, carbohydrates) of different items.
Identify trends and patterns in the dataset.

Data Visualization:
Create bar charts, histograms, and box plots to visualize calorie distribution and nutritional content.
Compare nutritional characteristics of different food categories (e.g., burgers, salads, desserts).

Nutrition-Based Insights:
Identify menu items with the highest and lowest calorie counts.
Determine the average nutritional content of popular menu categories.
Documentation and Reporting:

Summarize the findings and insights from the analysis.
Explain how the nutritional analysis could benefit McDonald's customers and the organization.
